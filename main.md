.# Abstract 

This document specifies conventions for creating JSON Web Token (JWT)
documents that support selective disclosure of JWT claim values. 

{mainmatter}

# Introduction {#Introduction}

The JSON-based claims in a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) [@!RFC7519] document are
secured against modification using JSON Web Signature (JWS) [@!RFC7515] digital
signatures. A consumer of a signed JWT document that has checked the document's
signature can safely assume that the contents of the document have not been
modified.  However, anyone receiving an unencrypted JWT can read all of the
claims and likewise, anyone with the decryption key receiving an encrypted JWT
can also read all of the claims.

This document describes a format for signed JWTs that supports selective
disclosure (SD-JWT), enabling sharing only a subset of the claims included in
the original signed JWT instead of releasing all the claims to every verifier.
During issuance, an SD-JWT is sent from the issuer to the holder alongside an
SD-JWT Salt/Value Container (SVC), a JSON object that contains the mapping
between raw claim values contained in the SD-JWT and the salts for each claim
value. 

This document also defines a format for SD-JWT Releases (SD-JWT-R), which convey
a subset of the claim values of an SD-JWT to the verifier. For presentation, the
holder creates an SD-JWT-R and sends it together with the SD-JWT to the
verifier. To verify claim values received in SD-JWT-R, the verifier uses the
salts values in the SD-JWT-R to compute the hash digests of the claim values and
compare them to the ones in the SD-JWT.

One of the common use cases of a signed JWT is representing a user's identity
created by an issuer. As long as the signed JWT is one-time use, it typically
only contains those claims the user has consented to release to a specific
verifier. However, when a signed JWT is intended to be multi-use, it needs to
contain the superset of all claims the user might want to release to verifiers
at some point. The ability to selectively disclose a subset of these claims
depending on the verifier becomes crucial to ensure minimum disclosure and
prevent verifiers from obtaining claims irrelevant for the transaction at hand.

One example of such a multi-use JWT is a verifiable credential, a
tamper-evident credential with a cryptographically verifiable authorship that
contains claims about a subject. SD-JWTs defined in this document enable such
selective disclosure of claims. 

While JWTs for claims describing natural persons are a common use case, the
mechanisms defined in this document can be used for many other use cases as
well.

This document also describes holder binding, or the concept of binding SD-JWT to
key material controlled by the subject of SD-JWT. Holder binding is optional to
implement.


## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

**base64url** denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding defined in
Section 2 of [@!RFC7515].

# Terms and Definitions

Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) 
:  A JWT [@!RFC7515] created by the issuer, which is signed as a JWS [@!RFC7515], 
   that supports selective disclosure as defined in this document.

SD-JWT Salt/Value Container (SVC) 
:  A JSON object created by the issuer that contains mapping between 
   raw claim values contained in the SD-JWT and the salts for each claim value.

SD-JWT Release (SD-JWT-R) 
:  A JWT created by the holder that contains a subset of the claim values of an SD-JWT in a verifiable way. 

Holder binding 
:  Ability of the holder to prove legitimate possession of SD-JWT by proving 
   control over the same private key during the issuance and presentation. SD-JWT signed by the issuer contains
   a public key or a reference to a public key that matches to the private key controlled by the holder.

Issuer 
:  An entity that creates SD-JWTs (2.1).

Holder 
:  An entity that received SD-JWTs (2.1) from the issuer and has control over them.

Verifier 
:  An entity that requests, checks and extracts the claims from SD-JWT-R (2.2)

Note: discuss if we want to include Client, Authorization Server for the purpose of
ensuring continuity and separating the entity from the actor.

# Concepts

From the point of view of the collection limitation, which is one of the main privacy principles, it is desirable to be able to provide only the claims necessary for the verifier to process. In the case of a standard JWT [RFC7519], however, this can only be achieved when the JWT is minted afresh each time and it is not possible to re-use the JWT that is pre-minted for other occasions. For example, a holder may want to re-use the document that contains name, address (municipality, street address, room number), date of birth, and National Identification Number to prove that he is a resident of the municipality so that he can receive the service to the resident. In the case of the normal JWT, this is not possible as the signature is over the entire claim set directly. To achieve it, a JWT that only contains the claim about the municipality needs to be minted. 

Selective disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) aims to address this issue by introducing an indirection: sign the salted hash of the claims instead of the claim set and provide only the claim value of the claim that is required to be processed by the receiver, which assumes the verifier role. This way, while the claim names and the salted hash of the claim values of all the claims contained in the document issued by the issuer is disclosed, the claim values of other claims are not in principle. 

In this document, a protocol is considered to fulfil the selective disclosure property when it has the following properties: 

## R1. Strong uncoverability

A protocol is said to achieve strong uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier, with a probability significantly better than negligible. 

## R2. Weak uncoverability

While strong uncoverability is desirable, it is not trivial to achieve it. For example, if the original document was a passport that came with the signature of the national authority, then just by looking at the issuer and its signature, it is trivial to find the nationality of the subject in the release. Also, if the existence of the claim name in the release makes it possible for the verifier to guess the value with a probability significantly better than negligible, then it does not satisfy strong uncoverability. 

With these considerations, weak uncoverability is defined as follows: 

A protocol is said to achieve weak uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier from the section of the release that directly corresponds with the claim, with a probability significantly better than negligible.  

## R3. Release confidentiality

A protocol is said to achieve release confidentiality if the adversary that can observe the content of all protocol exchanges between the holder agent and the verifier cannot find the claims with a probability significantly better than negligible. 

## R4. Unforgeability

Unforegeability ensures that an adversary acting as a holder (dishonest holder) cannot forge a release that makes the verifier believe the false value.  

The game is defined as follows. Arbitrary entities play the role of issuer and verifier while the adversary plays the role of the holder at each stage of the protocol. A is subjected to the game where sequentially: 

1. Issuer and verifier execute the setup/registration phase (if any). 
2. Issuer and adversary playing the role of holder execute the issuance phase in which issuer issues claim set attached to the honest holder C to the adversary. 
3. Adversary playing the role of holder and verifier executes the release phase for a policy P that is not satisfied by C. 
4. The winning event for the adversary is defined as a successful authentication towards the verifier. 

The protocol achieves unforgeability if it is unfeasible for the adversary to win with a probability significantly better than negligible. 

## Security and privacy target of SD-JWT and SD-JWT release

T1. SD-JWT, SD-JWT release with associated protocol execution fulfils R2, R3, and R4. 

Note: See privacy consideration for more discussion.

In the following, the contents of SD-JWTs and SD-JWT Releases are described at a
conceptual level, abstracting from the data formats described afterwards.

## Creating an SD-JWT

An SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed document containing hash digests over the claim values with unique random salts and other metadata. 
It MUST be digitally signed using the issuer's private key.

```
SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, SD-CLAIMS)
SD-JWT = SD-JWT-DOC | SIG(SD-JWT-DOC, ISSUER-PRIV-KEY)
```

`SD-CLAIMS` can be a simple object with claim names mapped to hash digests over the claim values with unique random salts:
```
SD-CLAIMS = (
    CLAIM-NAME: HASH(SALT | CLAIM-VALUE)
)*
```

`SD-CLAIMS` can also be nested deeper to capture more complex objects, as will be shown later.

`SD-JWT` is sent from the issuer to the holder, together with the mapping of the plain-text claim values, the salt values, and potentially some other information. 

## Creating an SD-JWT Release

To disclose to a verifier a subset of the SD-JWT claim values, a holder creates a JWT such as the
following:

```
SD-JWT-RELEASE-DOC = (METADATA, SD-RELEASES)
SD-JWT-RELEASE = SD-JWT-RELEASE-DOC
```


`SD-RELEASES` follows the structure of `SD-CLAIMS` and can be a simple object with claim names mapped to values and salts:

```
SD-RELEASES = (
    CLAIM-NAME: (DISCLOSED-SALT, DISCLOSED-VALUE)
)
```

Just as `SD-CLAIMS`, `SD-RELEASES` can be more complex as well.

`SD-JWT-RELEASE` is sent together with `SD-JWT` from the holder to the
verifier.

## Optional Holder Binding

Some use-cases may require holder binding. 

If holder binding is desired, `SD-JWT` must contain information about key material controlled by the holder:

```
SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, HOLDER-PUBLIC-KEY, SD-CLAIMS)
```

Note: How the public key is included in SD-JWT is out of scope of this document. It can be passed by value or by reference.

With holder binding, the `SD-JWT-RELEASE` is signed by the holder using its private key. It therefore looks as follows:

```
SD-JWT-RELEASE = SD-JWT-RELEASE-DOC | SIG(SD-JWT-RELEASE-DOC, HOLDER-PRIV-KEY)
```


## Verifying an SD-JWT Release

A verifier checks that 

 * for each claim in `SD-JWT-RELEASE`, the hash digest `HASH(DISCLOSED-SALT | DISCLOSED-VALUE)` 
 matches the one under the given claim name in `SD-JWT`.
 * if holder binding is used, the `SD-JWT-RELEASE` was signed by
 the private key belonging to `HOLDER-PUBLIC-KEY`.

The detailed algorithm is described below.

# Data Formats

This section defines data formats for SD-JWTs (containing hash digests of the salted
claim values), SD-JWT Salt/Value Containers (containing the mapping of the
plain-text claim values and the salt values), and SD-JWT Releases (containing a
subset of the same mapping).

## Format of an SD-JWT

An SD-JWT is a JWT that MUST be signed using the issuer's private key. The
payload of an SD-JWT MUST contain the `sd_digests` and `sd_hash_alg` claims
described in the following, and MAY contain a holder's public key or a reference
thereto, as well as further claims such as `iss`, `iat`, etc. as defined or
required by the application using SD-JWTs.

### `sd_digests` Claim (Digests of Selectively Disclosable Claims)

An SD-JWT MUST include hash digests of the salted claim values that are included by the issuer
under the property `sd_digests`. 

The issuer MUST choose a unique and cryptographically random salt value
for each claim value. Each salt value
SHOULD contain at least 128 bits of pseudorandom data, making it hard for an
attacker to guess. The salt value MUST then be encoded as a string. It is
RECOMMENDED to base64url-encode the salt value.

The issuer MUST build the digests by hashing over a string that is formed by
JSON-encoding an ordered array containing the salt and the claim value, e.g.:
`["6qMQvRL5haj","Peter"]`. The digest value is then base64url-encoded. Note that
the precise JSON encoding can vary, and therefore, the JSON encodings MUST be
sent to the holder along with the SD-JWT, as described below. 


#### Flat and Structured `sd_digests` objects

The `sd_digests` object can be a 'flat' object, directly containing all claim
names and hashed claim values without any deeper structure. The `sd_digests`
object can also be a 'structured' object, where some claims and their respective
hash digests are contained in places deeper in the structure. It is at the issuer's
discretion whether to use a 'flat' or 'structured' `sd_digests` SD-JWT object,
and how to structure it such that it is suitable for the use case. 

Example 1 below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT using a 'flat'
`sd_digests` object and Example 2 in the appendix shows a non-normative example
of an SD-JWT using a 'structured' `sd_digests` object. The difference between
the examples is how the `address` claim is disclosed.

Appendix 2 shows a more complex example using claims from eKYC (todo:
reference).

### Hash Function Claim

The claim `sd_hash_alg` indicates the hash algorithm used by the Issuer to generate
the hashes of the salted claim values. The hash algorithm identifier MUST be a
value from the "Hash Name String" column in the IANA "Named Information Hash
Algorithm" registry [IANA.Hash.Algorithms]. SD-JWTs with hash algorithm
identifiers not found in this registry are not considered valid and MUST NOT be
accepted by verifiers.

### Holder Public Key Claim

If the issuer wants to enable holder binding, it MAY include a public key
associated with the holder, or a reference thereto. 

It is out of the scope of this document to describe how the holder key pair is
established. For example, the holder MAY provide a key pair to the issuer, 
the issuer MAY create the key pair for the holder, or
holder and issuer MAY use pre-established key material.

Note: Examples in this document use `cnf` Claim defined in [@RFC7800] to include raw public key by value in SD-JWT.

## Example 1: SD-JWT

This example and Example 2 in the appendix use the following object as the set
of claims that the Issuer is issuing:

{#example-simple-user_claims}
```json
{
  "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
  "given_name": "John",
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
  "address": {
    "street_address": "123 Main St",
    "locality": "Anytown",
    "region": "Anystate",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
}
```

The following non-normative example shows the payload of an SD-JWT. The issuer
is using a flat structure, i.e., all of the claims the `address` claim can only
be disclosed in full.

{#example-simple-sd_jwt_payload}
```json
{
  "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
  "cnf": {
    "jwk" : {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "n": "pm4bOHBg-oYhAyPWzR56AWX3rUIXp11_ICDkGgS6W3ZWLts-hzwI3x65659kg4hVo9dbGoCJE3ZGF_eaetE30UhBUEgpGwrDrQiJ9zqprmcFfr3qvvkGjtth8Zgl1eM2bJcOwE7PCBHWTKWYs152R7g6Jg2OVph-a8rq-q79MhKG5QoW_mTz10QT_6H4c7PjWG1fjh8hpWNnbP_pv6d1zSwZfc5fl6yVRL0DV0V3lGHKe2Wqf_eNGjBrBLVklDTk8-stX_MWLcR-EGmXAOv0UBWitS_dXJKJu-vXJyw14nHSGuxTIK2hx1pttMft9CsvqimXKeDTU14qQL1eE7ihcw",
        "e": "AQAB"
    }
  },
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516247022,
  "sd_hash_alg": "sha-256",
  "sd_digests": {
    "sub": "z4xgEco94diTaSruISPiE7o_wtmcOfnH_8R7X9Pa578",
    "given_name": "PvU7cWjuHUq6w-i9XFpQZhjT-uprQL3GH3mKsAJl0e0",
    "family_name": "H-Relr4cEBMlenyK1gvyx16QVpnt4MEclT5tP0aTLFU",
    "email": "ET2A1JQLF85ZpBulh6UFstGrSfR4B3KM-bjQVllhxqY",
    "phone_number": "SJnciB2DIRVA5cXBrdKoH6n45788mZyUn2rnv74uMVU",
    "address": "0FldqLfGnERPPVDC17od9xb4w3iRJTEQbW_Yk9AmnDw",
    "birthdate": "-L0kMgIbLXe3OEkKTUGwz_QKhjehDeofKGwoPrxLuo4"
  }
}
```

The SD-JWT is then signed by the issuer to create a document like the following:

{#example-simple-serialized_sd_jwt}

## Format of a SD-JWT Salt/Value Container (SVC)

Besides the SD-JWT itself, the holder needs to learn the raw claim values that
are contained in the SD-JWT, along with the precise input to the hash
calculation, and the salts. There MAY be other information the issuer needs to
communicate to the holder, such as a private key if the issuer selected the
holder key pair.

A SD-JWT Salt/Value Container (SVC) is a JSON object containing at least the
top-level property `sd_release`. Its structure mirrors the one of `sd_digests` in
the SD-JWT, but the values are the inputs to the hash calculations the issuer
used, as strings.

The SVC MAY contain further properties, for example, to transport the holder
private key.

## Example: SVC for the Flat SD-JWT in Example 1

The SVC for Example 1 is as follows:

{#example-simple-svc_payload}
```json
{
  "sd_release": {
    "sub": "[\"2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w\", \"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\"]",
    "given_name": "[\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\", \"John\"]",
    "family_name": "[\"6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA\", \"Doe\"]",
    "email": "[\"eI8ZWm9QnKPpNPeNenHdhQ\", \"johndoe@example.com\"]",
    "phone_number": "[\"Qg_O64zqAxe412a108iroA\", \"+1-202-555-0101\"]",
    "address": "[\"AJx-095VPrpTtN4QMOqROA\", {\"street_address\": \"123 Main St\", \"locality\": \"Anytown\", \"region\": \"Anystate\", \"country\": \"US\"}]",
    "birthdate": "[\"Pc33JM2LchcU_lHggv_ufQ\", \"1940-01-01\"]"
  }
}
```

Important: As described above, hash digests are calculated over the string formed by
serializing a JSON array containing the salt and the claim value. This ensures
that issuer and verifier use the same input to their hash functions and avoids
issues with canonicalization of JSON values that would lead to different hash
digests. The SVC therefore maps claim names to JSON-encoded arrays. 

## Sending SD-JWT and SVC during Issuance

For transporting the SVC together with the SD-JWT from the issuer to the holder,
the SVC is base64url-encoded and appended to the SD-JWT using a period character `.` as the
separator. 

The SVC and SD-JWT are implicitly linked through the hash values of the claims
in the SVC that is included in the SD-JWT. To ensure that the correct SVC and 
SD-JWT pairings are being used, the holder SHOULD verify the binding between
SVC and SD-JWT as defined in the Verification Section of this document.

For Example 1, the combined format looks as follows:

{#example-simple-combined_sd_jwt_svc}
```

## Format of an SD-JWT Release

SD-JWT-R contains claim values and the salts of the claims that the holder 
has consented to release to the Verifier. This enables the Verifier to verify 
the claims received from the holder by computing the hash digests of the claim
values and the salts revealed in the SD-JWT-R using the hashing algorithm 
specified in SD-JWT and comparing them to the hash digests included in SD-JWT.

For each claim, an array of the salt and the claim value is contained in the
`sd_release` object. The structure of `sd_release` object in the SD-JWT-R is the same as in SD-JWT. 

The SD-JWT-R MAY contain further claims, for example, to ensure a binding
to a concrete transaction (in the example the `nonce` and `aud` claims).

When the holder sends the SD-JWT-R to the Verifier, the SD-JWT-R MUST be a JWS 
represented as the JWS Compact Serialization as described in 
Section 7.1 of [@!RFC7515].

If holder binding is desired, the SD-JWT-R is signed by the holder. If no
holder binding is to be used, the `none` algorithm is used, i.e., the document
is not signed. TODO: Change to plain base64 to avoid alg=none issues

## Example: SD-JWT Release for Example 1

The following is a non-normative example of the contents of an SD-JWT-R for Example 1:

{#example-simple-sd_jwt_release_payload}
```json
{
  "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
  "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
  "sd_release": {
    "given_name": "[\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\", \"John\"]",
    "family_name": "[\"6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA\", \"Doe\"]",
    "address": "[\"AJx-095VPrpTtN4QMOqROA\", {\"street_address\": \"123 Main St\", \"locality\": \"Anytown\", \"region\": \"Anystate\", \"country\": \"US\"}]"
  }
}
```

For each claim, an array of the salt and the claim value is contained in the
`sd_release` object. 

Again, the SD-JWT-R follows the same structure as the `sd_digests` in the SD-JWT. 

Below is a non-normative example of a representation of the SD-JWT-R JWS Compact
Serialization:

# Verification

## Verification by the Holder when Receiving SD-JWT and SVC

The holder SHOULD verify the binding between SD-JWT and SVC by performing the following steps:
 1. Check that all the claims in the SVC are present in the SD-JWT and that there are no claims in the SD-JWT that are not in the SVC
 2. Check that the hashes of the claims in the SVC match those in the SD-JWT

## Verification by the Verifier when Receiving SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R

Verifiers MUST follow [@RFC8725] for checking the SD-JWT and, if signed, the
SD-JWT Release.

Verifiers MUST go through (at least) the following steps before
trusting/using any of the contents of an SD-JWT:

 1. Determine if holder binding is to be checked for the SD-JWT. Refer to (#holder_binding_security) for details.
 2. Check that the presentation consists of six period-separated (`.`) elements; if holder binding is not required, the last element can be empty.
 3. Separate the SD-JWT from the SD-JWT Release.
 4. Validate the SD-JWT:
    1. Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed secure for the application. Refer to [@RFC8725], Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for details.
    2. Validate the signature over the SD-JWT. 
    3. Validate the issuer of the SD-JWT and that the signing key belongs to this issuer.
    4. Check that the SD-JWT is valid using `nbf`, `iat`, and `exp` claims, if provided in the SD-JWT.
    5. Check that the claim `sd_digests` is present in the SD-JWT.
    6. Check that the `sd_hash_alg` claim is present and its value is understand
       and the hash algorithm is deemed secure.
 5. Validate the SD-JWT Release:
    1. If holder binding is required, validate the signature over the SD-JWT using the same steps as for the SD-JWT plus the following steps:
       1. Determine that the public key for the private key that used to sign the SD-JWT-R is bound to the SD-JWT, i.e., the SD-JWT either contains a reference to the public key or contains the public key itself.
       2. Determine that the SD-JWT-R is bound to the current transaction and was created for this verifier (replay protection). This is usually achieved by a `nonce` and `aud` field within the SD-JWT Release.
    2. For each claim in the SD-JWT Release:
       1. Ensure that the claim is present as well in `sd_release` in the SD-JWT.
          If `sd_release` is structured, the claim MUST be present at the same
          place within the structure.
       2. Compute the base64url-encoded hash of a claim revealed from the Holder
          using the claim value and the salt included in the SD-JWT-R and 
          the `sd_hash_alg` in SD-JWT.
       3. Compare the hash digests computed in the previous step with the one of the same claim in the SD-JWT. 
          Accept the claim only when the two hash digests match.
       4. Ensure that the claim value in the SD-JWT-R is a JSON-encoded
          array of exactly two values.
       5. Store the second of the two values. 
    3. Once all necessary claims have been verified, their values can be
       validated and used according to the requirements of the application. It
       MUST be ensured that all claims required for the application have been
       released.

If any step fails, the input is not valid and processing MUST be aborted.


# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

## Mandatory hash computation of the revealed claim values by the Verifier

ToDo: add text explaining mechanisms that should be adopted to ensure that 
  verifiers validate the claim values received in SD-JWT-R by calculating the
  hashes of those values and comparing them with the hashes in the SD-JWT: 
  - create a test suite that forces hash computation by the Verifiers, 
    and includes negative test cases in test vectors
  - use only implementations/libraries that are compliant to the test suite 
  - etc.

## Mandatory signing of the SD-JWT

The SD-JWT MUST be signed by the issuer to protect integrity of the issued
claims. An attacker can modify or add claims if an SD-JWT is not signed (e.g.,
change the "email" attribute to take over the victim's account or add an
attribute indicating a fake academic qualification).

The verifier MUST always check the SD-JWT signature to ensure that the SD-JWT
has not been tampered with since its issuance. If the signature on the SD-JWT
cannot be verified, the SD-JWT MUST be rejected. 

## Entropy and Uniqueness of the salt

The security model relies on the fact that the salt is not learned or guessed by
the attacker. It is vitally important to adhere to this principle. As such, the
salt MUST be created in such a manner that it is cryptographically random,
long enough and has high entropy that it is not practical for the attacker to
guess. Each salt value MUST be unique.

## Minimum length of the salt

The length of the randomly-generated portion of the salt MUST be at least 128 bits.

## Choice of a hash function

For the security of this scheme, the hash function is required to be preimage and collision
resistant, i.e., it is infeasible to calculate the salt and claim value that result in
a particular digest, and it is infeasible to find a different salt and claim value pair that
result in a matching digest, respectively.

Furthermore the hash algorithms MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, and SHA-1 
revealed fundamental weaknesses and they MUST NOT be used.

## Holder Binding {#holder_binding_security}
TBD

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy_considerations}

## Claim Names

Claim names are not hashed in the SD-JWT and are used as keys in a key-value pair, where the value is the hash.
This is because SD-JWT already reveals information about the issuer and the schema,
and revealing the claim names does not provide any additional information.

## Unlinkability 

Colluding issuer/verifier or verifier/verifier pairs could link issuance/presentation or two presentation sessions
to the same user on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT
(issuer signature, salts, digests, etc.). More advanced cryptographic schemes, outside the scope of
this specification, can be used to prevent this type of linkability.

# Additional Examples

## Example 2 - Structured SD-JWT
This non-normative example is based on the same claim values as Example 1, but
this time the issuer decided to create a structured object for the hashes. This
allows for the release of individual members of the address claim separately.

}
```

An SD-JWT-R for the SD-JWT above that discloses only `region` and `country` of
the `address` property:

{#example-simple_structured-sd_jwt_release_payload}
```json
{
  "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
  "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
  "sd_release": {
    "given_name": "[\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\", \"John\"]",
    "family_name": "[\"6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA\", \"Doe\"]",
    "birthdate": "[\"nPuoQnkRFq3BIeAm7AnXFA\", \"1940-01-01\"]",
    "address": {

      "country": "[\"lklxF5jMYlGTPUovMNIvCA\", \"US\"]"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example 3 - Complex Structured SD-JWT

In this example, a complex object such as those used for OIDC4IDA (todo reference) is used.

In this example, the Issuer is using a following object as a set of claims to issue to the Holder:

{#example-complex-user_claims}
```json
{
  "verified_claims": {
    "verification": {
      "trust_framework": "de_aml",
      "time": "2012-04-23T18:25Z",
      "verification_process": "f24c6f-6d3f-4ec5-973e-b0d8506f3bc7",
      "evidence": [
        {

          "document": {
            "type": "idcard",
            "issuer": {
              "name": "Stadt Augsburg",
              "country": "DE"
            },
            "number": "53554554",
            "date_of_issuance": "2010-03-23",
            "date_of_expiry": "2020-03-22"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "claims": {
      "given_name": "Max",
      "family_name": "Meier",
      "birthdate": "1956-01-28",
      "place_of_birth": {
        "country": "DE",
        "locality": "Musterstadt"
      },
      "nationalities": [
        "DE"
      ],
      "address": {
        "locality": "Maxstadt",
        "postal_code": "12344",
        "country": "DE",
        "street_address": "An der Weide 22"
      }
    }
  },
  "birth_middle_name": "Timotheus",
  "salutation": "Dr.",
  "msisdn": "49123456789"
}
```

The following shows the resulting SD-JWT payload:

## Example 4 - W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model

This example illustrates how the artifacts defined in this specification can be
represented using W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model as defined in
[@VC_DATA].

Below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT represented as a verifiable credential 
encoded as JSON and signed as JWS compliant to [@VC_DATA].

SVC sent alongside this SD-JWT as a JWT-VC is same as in Example 1.

# Document History

   [[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

   -02

   *  Added acknowledgements
   *  Improved Security Considerations
   *  Stressed uniqueness requirements for salts
   *  Python reference implementation clean-up and refactoring
   *  hash_alg renamed to sd_hash_alg

   -01
   
   *  Editorial fixes
   *  Added `hash_alg` claim
   *  Renamed `_sd` to `sd_digests` and `sd_release`
   *  Added descriptions on holder binding - more work to do
   *  Clarify that signing the SD-JWT is mandatory

   -00

   *  Renamed to SD-JWT (focus on JWT instead of JWS since signature is optional)
   *  Make holder binding optional
   *  Rename proof to release, since when there is no signature, the term "proof" can be misleading
   *  Improved the structure of the description
   *  Described verification steps
   *  All examples generated from python demo implementation
   *  Examples for structured objects
